# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 AI Crowd Management System

## 📌 Overview

The **AI Crowd Management System** is an intelligent surveillance solution that leverages **Computer Vision and Deep Learning** to monitor and analyze crowd density in real time using CCTV footage.
It helps in **safety monitoring, event management, and emergency response** by detecting overcrowded areas and sending timely alerts.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎥 **Real-time CCTV Integration** – Uses video feeds as input.
* 🧠 **AI-Powered Crowd Detection** – Detects and counts people using object detection models (YOLO/SSD/RCNN).
* 📊 **Density Analysis** – Estimates crowd size and density for different zones.
* 🔔 **Alert System** – Generates alerts if the density exceeds a safe threshold.
* 📈 **Dashboard Visualization** – Displays live stats, graphs, and heatmaps.
* 🌐 **Scalable & Modular** – Can be deployed in **stadiums, public events, transport hubs, or smart cities**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (for dashboard)
* **Frameworks**: OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Flask/Django
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js/React for visualization)
* **Database**: SQLite / MongoDB
* **Deployment**: Docker / Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Capture video stream** from CCTV.
2. **Apply AI-based person detection** (YOLO/SSD).
3. **Count people & estimate density**.
4. **Trigger alerts** if crowd > threshold.
5. **Display results** on web dashboard.
